# LangChain

**LangChain** is one of the most popular LLM application development framework to build a chatbot.

It enables applications that are context aware and rely on language model to answer given the question and the context. 

It offers multitude of components that help us build LLM-powered applications with minimal effort.

A few components are:
- LLMs
- prompts
- memory
- chains
- vector stores
- document loaders 

These components are **easily exchangeable** as well. For example, we can switch between, say, one LLM with another LLM with minimal code changes.
