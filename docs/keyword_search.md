# Keyword Search

Keywords, also commonly called *search terms*, are the words or phrases that are used to match with the terms people are searching for when looking for products, services, or general information. 

This is the **simplest form of search** where the system looks for **exact matches** of the user provided keywords in the database or index. This is a form of lexical search because it focuses on the literal text of the query. This approach is effective for straightforward queries, but **may not always return the most relevant results for complex or nuanced questions**.

Keyword search evaluate documents on the **presence and frequency of the query term**. BM25 is a commonly used keyword search algorithm.
